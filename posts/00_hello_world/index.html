<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<time datetime="2024-05-31">31 May 2024</time>
</div>

<div class="post">
<p>I guess it is a suitable first post for a blog about programming. I'm neither an engineer nor a programmer per se, but I'm an enthusiast and an aspiring developer. I was born in an internetless era, so everything that has been made so far has been magical to me, and it has been my true interest and hobby since I was a child. I started to get serious about it, which is relatively new. For more than two years, I have been studying at bootcamps, in certification programs, for an undergraduate degree, and so on.</p>
<p>In other words, I have been in tutorial hell. And I will continue to be. Because I'm still learning and discovering. This blog is another part of it.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a blog for a very long time; better late than never. In this blog, I will share what I learned and how I learned it. Maybe in time I can start to share what I created as well. Wishful thinking for now.</p>
<p>You can find all my study notes, my resources, and my conclusions. I will try to organize the information to be useful, foremost for me. The details, the how-tos, and the and the tricks are hard to come by. If anyone willingly starts to read this blog, they can be a fellow traveler with me on this never-ending journey of learning.</p>
<p>I will try to keep my opinions out of them, because the web is full of it, and nowadays it has become a pollution. And I will try to be responsible with your time; I don't want to waste it on arguments. My point is that this blog aims to be useful, not wasteful.</p>
<p>Hello, world.... These are the words we print out in every programming tutorialâ€”the first and most simple programs we write. It became a tradition, which I am fond of. Because it implies excitement and ambition. I think this is the first small step to greatness. What we are going to do is important enough to announce to the world.</p>
<p>And the first words of a baby program, saluting as well. I may not create a blog that matters to the world. Far from greatness, more like a study book.</p>
<p>Anyway, welcome!</p>
