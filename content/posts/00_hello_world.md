I guess it is a suitable first post for a blog about programming. I'm neither an engineer nor a programmer per se, but I'm an enthusiast and an aspiring developer. I was born in an internetless era, so everything that has been made so far has been magical to me, and it has been my true interest and hobby since I was a child. I started to get serious about it, which is relatively new. For more than two years, I have been studying at bootcamps, in certification programs, for an undergraduate degree, and so on.

In other words, I have been in tutorial hell. And I will continue to be. Because I'm still learning and discovering. This blog is another part of it.

I wanted to create a blog for a very long time; better late than never. In this blog, I will share what I learned and how I learned it. Maybe in time I can start to share what I created as well. Wishful thinking for now.

You can find all my study notes, my resources, and my conclusions. I will try to organize the information to be useful, foremost for me. The details, the how-tos, and the and the tricks are hard to come by. If anyone willingly starts to read this blog, they can be a fellow traveler with me on this never-ending journey of learning.

I will try to keep my opinions out of them, because the web is full of it, and nowadays it has become a pollution. And I will try to be responsible with your time; I don't want to waste it on arguments. My point is that this blog aims to be useful, not wasteful.

Hello, world.... These are the words we print out in every programming tutorial—the first and most simple programs we write. It became a tradition, which I am fond of. Because it implies excitement and ambition. I think this is the first small step to greatness. What we are going to do is important enough to announce to the world. 

And the first words of a baby program, saluting as well. I may not create a blog that matters to the world. Far from greatness, more like a study book.

Anyway, welcome!
